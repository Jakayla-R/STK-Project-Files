# STK-Project-Files
Simulation models and scripts for trajectory analysis of spacecraft using STK and Python/MATLAB integration

STK Analysis Workbench: 


STK Coverage: In this simulation we use STK to model Earth observing payloads attached to sensors located in 3 different orbits. 
Task completed: 
-Comupted global coverage
-Computed coverage in designated areas
-Understand a coverage grid 
-Use constraints in a coverage grid 
-Determined coverage assets
-Chose which data providers supply answers
-Created color contours pertaining to the coverage analysis in the 2D and #D Graphics windows
